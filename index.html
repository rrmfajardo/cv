    I am a legitimate Engineer from <a href="https://www.mapua.edu.ph">Mapua University</a>. Presently here at <a href="https://www.timesinteriordesign.com">Times Interior Design LLC</a>, where I was employed as a QS – Project Engineer, quantity
    surveying jobs with complete price assessment and project management are being practice into perfection. I am well-versed in DIALux Design Software.
  </p>
  <p>
    Believing that I have the DNA to bring the right combination of analytical acumen, persistence, precision workmanship, technical knowledge of an engineer, management, experience to be a good fit to whatever role, and to be able to contribute
    something of value to your organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a candidate with strong written and oral communications skills, as well as experience with event planning and strategy development. As a part-time working student in Dulalia Realty, I am responsible for assisting the project manager in terms
    of logistics in planning department. Whereas in SHI Plastic Machinery (Phils.), Inc., I have started learning the trades of being Service Technician basics.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my final term in the university, I led a group of students to a 1st Runner-up Finish for Best Thesis – “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9400061">Impact Study of a Microgrid with Battery Energy Storage System BESS and Hybrid
      Distributed Energy Resources using MATLAB Simulink</a>, October 2020.” Thru this achievement, we were chosen to represent our country Philippines in the International field – HNICEM, Japan last January 2021. Through this project, I learned how
    to collaborate with others and work effectively in a team to accomplish a common goal.
